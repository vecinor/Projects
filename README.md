# My Portfolio

A portfolio is a collection of representative work. My portfolio is a set of different projects that I have done during my academic time. My portfolio includes the works that I have coded in R notebooks (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview), Python

A notebook is a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that I have learned in this class. In the paragraphs bellow I explain with more details the skills that I have demostrated.

Some example skills that I have demonstrated with R:
- Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).
- Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).
- Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include pivot-wider and pivot-longer).
- Data science process (major steps).
